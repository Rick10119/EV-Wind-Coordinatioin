# EV-Wind-Coordinatioin
Emission-concerned wind-electric vehicle (EV) coordination on the transmission grid side

# modeling of EV (mainly from number/Electricity/arriving and leaving time, to the limitation of charging power) l1
# modeling of thermal and wind power (margin) l2
# min cost s.t. l1 & l2
# => charging demand/strategy of EV
